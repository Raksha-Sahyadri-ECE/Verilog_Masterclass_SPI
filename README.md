# Verilog_Masterclass_SPI

This project implements a simple **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Master** in Verilog, along with a testbench to simulate its behavior using **ModelSim**.

## What is SPI?

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a **synchronous serial communication protocol** commonly used to transfer data between microcontrollers and peripheral devices such as sensors, SD cards, and displays.

It uses the following main signals:
- **SCLK (spi_clk)** – Serial Clock (generated by Master)
- **MOSI (spi_data)** – Master Out Slave In (data sent from Master)
- **SS** – Slave Select (not used in this basic version)
- **MISO** – Master In Slave Out (not used here)

This project includes
- An **8-bit SPI master** that sends data serially over `spi_data`
- A clock divider to generate a slower SPI clock from a 100 MHz system clock
- A testbench to simulate and verify the SPI output behavior

|-------------|------------------------------------|
| `spi.v`     | SPI master (8-bit) implementation  |
| `spi_tb.v`  | Testbench to simulate SPI master   |
| `spi_run.do`| Script to compile and run in ModelSim |

## How to Simulate

1. Open ModelSim and create a new project
2. Add `spi.v`, `spi_tb.v`, and `spi_run.do` to the project
3. In the **Transcript** window, run:

```tcl
do spi_run.do
